## Developer Names:

- Alex Rothauge
- Redwan Obid
- Jann Karsten
- John Fleischhacker
- Dominik Robin Esser

## Deployment

The current state of Master in running on [spaceplayer.ga](http://spaceplayer.ga). We Deployed our Application using Google Cloud. There we have a simple e2-standard Virtual Machine with ubuntu running. On this we basically performed the same steps as described in **local dev Setup**. We have no automatic deployment via git ci.

## local dev setup

To make the project running you want to perform the following steps:
Create environment file, you can Change the values if you want so,
but it is not necessary

- `cp ./infra/env_vars/.env.example ./infra/env_vars/.env`

#### Install npm packages for backend and frontend

- `docker-compose run backend npm install`
- `docker-compose run frontend npm install`

#### Start containers

- `docker-compose up` / `docker-compose up -d`

#### Sync database schema

- `docker-compose exec backend npm run typeorm schema:sync`

_the application should now be up and running, you can access the frontend via `localhost:3000/`, the backend API is running on `localhost:4000/api` and the game Server is running on `localhost:5000`._

#### Run backend tests

- `docker-compose exec backend npm run test`

#### Run frontend tests

- `docker-compose exec frontend npm run test`

#### Run End To End tests

- `cd .\packages\cypress\`
- `npm install`
- `npm run cypress`

## üïπÔ∏è Playing

Want to play right away? You can play the game by following (and sharing) this link https://spaceplayer.ga

**Game principles**

1. Every player is positioned randomly on the map
2. You can increase your score by shooting Astroids, Jellyfish or taking down other player
3. There is a chance to drop one of 4 different Powerups while shooting Astroids or Jellyfish
4. Every shoot costs 50 Shooting Power which is regenarated over time
5. You lose HP by colliding with Astroids, Jellyfish or getting Shot

You can see a very small amount of gameplay below:
